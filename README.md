Description:
Developed an autonomous object detection and pick-and-place robotic system using a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robotic arm (MyCobot) controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4B and an ESP32 board. The system utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection and OpenCV for image processing, achieving precise and efficient sorting of colored objects.

Key Contributions:

Designed and Implemented an autonomous robotic system that performs object detection and sorting with a 98% accuracy rate using YOLOv8 model.
Integrated MyCobot 6-DOF robotic arm with Raspberry Pi 4B and ESP32, enabling precise control and real-time object manipulation.
Developed custom Python scripts for real-time image processing and object detection using OpenCV, enhancing the system’s efficiency and accuracy.
Calibrated the robotic arm and camera system using ArUco markers for precise object positioning and movement coordination.
Implemented adaptive HSV color detection algorithm to accurately identify and sort objects into predefined categories.
Optimized the robotic arm’s movements and vacuum pump control to ensure reliable and efficient pick-and-place operations.
Utilized serial communication to interface between the Raspberry Pi 4B, ESP32, and MyCobot, ensuring seamless data exchange and command execution.
Achieved a 95% reduction in sorting time compared to manual processes by automating the object detection and sorting task.
Tested and Validated the system under various conditions to ensure robustness and reliability, demonstrating consistent performance across multiple test scenarios.
